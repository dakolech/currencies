## Install

In the project directory, you should run:

### `yarn`

to install all dependencies

## Run application

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>


## Additional info

I've used TypeScript, because it is a natural extension to JavaScript. I'm a big fan of this technology and in my opinion I can write code faster and make it with less errors.

I could do tests also to epics, reducers, selectors.

Api Service was written by me for another project, so I just copied it with tests.

Layout is very simple, unfortunately I don't have design skills.
